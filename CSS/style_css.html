<p id=Home>The Indian Space Research Organisation, commonly referred to as ISRO[a] (/ˈɪsroʊ/), is the national space agency of India. It operates under the Department of Space (DOS) which is directly overseen by the Prime Minister of India, while the Chairman of ISRO also acts as the executive of DOS. ISRO is primarily responsible for performing tasks related to space-based applications, space exploration, international space cooperation and the development of related technologies.[5] It is one of the six government space agencies in the world which possess full launch capabilities, deploy cryogenic engines, launch extraterrestrial missions and operates a large fleet of artificial satellites.[6][7][b]

ISRO has the world's largest constellation of remote-sensing satellites and operates the GAGAN and IRNSS (NavIC) satellite navigation systems. It has sent three missions to the Moon and one to Mars.

Goals in near future include expanding satellites fleet, landing a rover on Moon, sending humans into space, development of a semi-cryogenic engine, sending more uncrewed missions to the Moon, Mars, Venus and the Sun and deployment of more space telescopes in orbit to observe cosmic phenomena and outerspace beyond the Solar System. Long-term plans include development of reusable launchers, heavy and super heavy launch vehicles, deploying a space station, sending exploration missions to planets like Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and asteroids and crewed missions to moons and planets.

ISRO's programmes have played a significant role in the socio-economic development of India and have supported both civilian and military domains in various aspects including disaster management, telemedicine and navigation and reconnaissance missions. ISRO's spin off technologies also have founded many crucial innovations for India's engineering and medical industries.The Indian Space Research Organisation, commonly referred to as ISRO[a] (/ˈɪsroʊ/), is the national space agency of India.

ISRO was previously The Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), set up by The Government of India in 1962, as envisioned by scientist Vikram Sarabhai, recognising the need in space research. INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969, within DAE.[8] In 1972, the government of India set up a Space Commission and DOS, bringing ISRO under it. The establishment of ISRO thus institutionalised space research activities in India.[9][10] It since then has been managed by DOS, which governs various other institutions in India in the domain of astronomy and space technology.[11]

ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, which was launched by the Soviet space agency Interkosmos in 1975.[12] In 1980, ISRO launched satellite RS-1 onboard its own SLV-3, making India the seventh country to be capable of undertaking orbital launches. SLV-3 was followed by ASLV, which was subsequently succeeded by development of many medium-lift launch vehicles, rocket engines, satellite systems and networks enabling the agency to launch hundreds of domestic and foreign satellites and various deep space missions for space exploration.
